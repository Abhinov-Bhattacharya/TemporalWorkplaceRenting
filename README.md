## Introduction
An Integrated Workplace Management System (IWMS) is software that helps in providing a pleasant 
workplace and required resources for developing organizations and to individuals to carry out their 
work or projects without any risks. This software system enables individuals to use the resources available at the workplace efficiently 
to complete their work. The workplace can be even called as temporary office space. 
The user requires paying for the workspace and resources used in the workspace. Resources used 
includes getting assistance from various developed organizations, usage of high speed WIFI data, air 
conditioners, seminar halls for conducting various meetings and interviews etc. like a plug and play. Setting up of such a workspace on our own requires a lot of investment and time. Maintenance cost of such a own workspace may not meet our estimated budget. Limited workspace of small area may not be sufficient to all employees which leads to congestion 
and overcrowding.
